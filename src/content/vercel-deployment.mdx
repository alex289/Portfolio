## Creating a Fullstack app with Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is one of the best frameworks in 2022 and has everything you need to create a fullstack application. With SSG and SSR, API routes and built-in optimization components you can create everything just with one simple and very performant app.

If you already use Next.js I recommend you to take a look at the [T3-Stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) which is a perfect boilerplate with all necessary tools like authentication and database connection.

## Free database service PlanetScale

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is an easy to use MySQL-compatible serverless database platform. It supports most programming languages and connectors and has great tools like branching and scalability even though the free-tier is enough for most personal projects.

Additionally it has a [Vercel tutorial](https://docs.planetscale.com/tutorials/deploy-to-vercel) and supports [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) which is included in the mentioned T3-Stack.

## Helpful libaries

Most applications need some kind of features which can easily be provided by Next.js supporting packages:

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - A database data-driven ORM
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - An easy to use utility-first CSS framework
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) - An flexible and secure authentication provider
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - A lightweight react hook for data fetching

## Deploy your app for free on Vercel

Now you are ready to deploy your app. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and deploy your app via a repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket or the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli). Also take a look at the available [Integrations](https://vercel.com/integrations) which are very helpful with many things like providing environment variables for CMS.

## Conclusion ðŸ”š

I hope I could help you create and deploy your own strong and performant app with only free tools.
