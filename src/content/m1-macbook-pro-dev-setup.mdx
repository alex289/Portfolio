## Inspiration

Before setting my machin up and knowing what good apps are out there I checked out these tutorials. Make sure to check them out.

## Essentials

> Before starting the actual setup please make sure your machine has the latest version and got all updates.

- Enable the firewall in the system settings! This is very important
- Install XCode

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

- Install the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Install the essential environments and CLIs you need

```bash
brew install git node neovim
```

- I really recommend signing your git commits. Read [here](https://withblue.ink/2020/05/17/how-and-why-to-sign-git-commits.html) why and how to do it.
- Now its time to create a `~/code` or `~/dev` folder and clone all your project repos locally.

## Apps & Programs

Install all apps and programs you need with brew. This is a list of all things I installed:

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2 visual-studio-code google-chrome notion spotify rectangle alt-tab devtoys postman stats 1password
```

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) - Terminal emulator
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Code editor
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - Browser for developing
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/de-de) - Tool for creating notes, docs and more
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) - Music provider
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) - Window management tool for macOS
- [Alt-Tab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app) - Windows alt-tab on macOS
- [Devtoys](https://github.com/ObuchiYuki/DevToysMac) - Useful developer tools
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) - API building and testing platform

## Terminal

> This requires the zsh command line which is the default on MacBooks since 2019.

- Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

- Install the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

- Install and set a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) of your choice
- Restart your terminal and configure Powerlevel10k

```bash
p10k configure
```

- Update your `~/.zshrc` to your liking. I have an example of what you can do in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/alex289/dotfiles/tree/main/mac).

## Useful packages

> Install all of these with `brew`.

- bat - view file contents in your terminal
- exa - better ls
- neovim - terminal code editor. I use the [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.github.io) configuration
- tmux - Terminal multiplexer
- zoxide - autojumper

The configuration and use of all of these can be seen in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/alex289/dotfiles/tree/main/mac).

### npm packages

- ESLint
- npm-check-updates
- pnpm
- prettier
- serve
- typescript

## System configuration

```

```
