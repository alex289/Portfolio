For my complete theme and configurations take a look at my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/Alex289/dotfiles)

## PowerShell

[PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is the best starting point for the terminal.
To install it go to the Microsoft store, search for "PowerShell" click install. ([Quicklink](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/powershell/9MZ1SNWT0N5D))

To get a better structured terminal install the Windows Terminal which manages your different installed terminals.
Available at the Microsoft store as well. ([Quicklink](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701))

After this u need to install any Nerdfont to display special characters in your terminal.
If you dont know anything about these I would recommend "MesloLGL Nerd Font". ([Quicklink](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads))

## Scoop

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a package manager for windows
To install it run the following commands in your new PowerShell environment:

```powershell
# Optional: Needed to run a remote script the first time
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

> irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

## oh-my-posh

To make your terminal prompt look better install [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) with the following command:

```powershell
> scoop install https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/oh-my-posh.json
```

After this add the following to your PowerShell profile. You can find your profile with `open $PROFILE` or `code $PROFILE`
if you have vscode installed.

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression
```

## Terminal Icons

[Terminal Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons) adds some icons to your `ls` command. Install it with:

```powershell
> Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons -Repository PSGallery
```

and add the following line to your profile:

```powershell
Import-Module Terminal-Icons
```

You can try it out after a reload. Type `ls` to see the icons.

## PSReadLine

One of the most powerfull tools for PowerShell is [PSReadLine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/). It adds autocompletion to speed up your workflow a lot.

```powershell
> Install-Module PSReadLine
```

And again enable it in your profile config:

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView
```

## z

[z](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/z) is a improved version of the `cd` command. You can jump from every folder to any other just by typing `z your-folder-name`.
Install it with:

```powershell
> Install-Module -Name z
```

### Neovim (Optional)

> This one is only for more experienced people. If you are new to programming you can probably skip this.

<Image

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a way to speed up your workflow by editing your code inside your terminal.

Install it with scoop:

```powershell
scoop install neovim
```

For a starter configuration I recommend the [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) config

## Useful npm packages

Here is a list of useful packages I use often:

- @angular/cli
- npm-check-updates
- prettier
- serve
- tree-sitter-cli (For neovim)
- typescript
- yarn
- nvm
- speed-test

## Useful PowerShell scripts

Here is a list of useful PowerShell scripts I recommend to add to your profile

#### aliases

```powershell
Set-Alias v nvim
Set-Alias g git
Set-Alias y yarn
Set-Alias ll ls
Set-Alias touch New-Item
```

#### which

To get the execution path of any program.

```powershell
function which ($command) {
  Get-Command -Name $command -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
```

#### transfer

Upload a file or folder to directly share it in seconds

```powershell
function transfer ($file) {
    curl -H "Max-Downloads: 1" -H "Max-Days: 5" --upload-file $file https://transfer.sh/$file
}
```

#### shortcuts

Insert commands by adding Shortcuts

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+q -ScriptBlock {
    [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::RevertLine()
    [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::Insert('exit')
    [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::AcceptLine()
}
```
