One of my greatest intellectual passions is understanding the world through patterns—not just in data and code, but in history itself. I'm fascinated by the idea that if we study history deeply enough, we can glimpse the future. This led me to discover Professor Jiang Xueqin's remarkable work on **Predictive History**.

## Discovering Predictive History

Professor Jiang Xueqin's "Predictive History" is an ambitious intellectual project that combines historical analysis, game theory, and mathematical modeling to forecast major geopolitical events before they occur. His core argument is both simple and profound: if history is properly studied, it should not only connect past events into a coherent narrative and explain the present—it should **predict the future**.

### The Vision: From Asimov to Reality

Jiang's approach draws heavily from the concept of **"psychohistory,"** inspired by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. In Asimov's novels, psychohistory is a fictional science that uses mathematics to predict the future behavior of large populations. While Asimov's version remains science fiction, Jiang argues that we can achieve something remarkably similar using real historical analysis.

### The Methodology

What makes Predictive History compelling is its interdisciplinary foundation:

- **Historiography**: Deep study of how historical events connect and repeat
- **Psychology**: Understanding human behavior and decision-making patterns
- **Mathematical Social Science**: Incorporating cliodynamics (Peter Turchin's approach to historical dynamics)
- **Game Theory**: Analyzing stakeholder motivations and strategic decisions

Jiang proposes that society's hidden dynamics and suppressed truths create **discoverable patterns**. By decoding these historical codes and applying game theory to stakeholder analysis, we can foresee future events—especially in geopolitics.

### Why This Matters

In our data-driven age, the idea that historical patterns can be quantified and used for prediction feels both ancient and cutting-edge. It bridges the humanities and sciences, showing that understanding the past isn't just academic—it's practical, actionable, and urgently relevant.

## Professor Jiang's YouTube Series

I've been deeply engaged with Professor Jiang's YouTube channel where he applies these principles to real-world geopolitical events. His analyses are thought-provoking, rigorous, and often prescient.

His videos demonstrate how historical patterns and game-theoretic analysis can illuminate contemporary conflicts, economic trends, and political transformations. Whether you're interested in international relations, history, or strategic thinking, this playlist offers a unique lens for understanding our rapidly changing world.

## My Confession: The Book Collector Who Doesn't Read (Enough)

Now for a more personal admission: I have a peculiar hobby—**collecting books I aspire to read but rarely find the time or discipline to actually finish**. There's something deeply satisfying about owning these intellectual treasures, even if they currently serve more as aspirational artifacts than completed conquests.

My shelves are lined with works spanning philosophy, finance, mathematics, physics, literature, and psychology. Each book represents a conversation I hope to have with a great mind, a world I plan to explore, or a skill I intend to master. One day.

### My Reading Wishlist

Here's my collection—books I genuinely want to read, understand, and integrate into my thinking:

### The Paradox of the Collector

Why collect books if I don't read them all? I've come to see this not as a character flaw but as a form of **intellectual optimism**. These books represent:

- **Future conversations** I want to have with brilliant minds
- **Skills and knowledge** I'm committed to acquiring
- **A curated path** through human wisdom and achievement
- **Physical reminders** of intellectual humility—there's always more to learn

Perhaps the collection itself is valuable. It's a personal library of unexplored possibilities, a map of intellectual territory I've marked for eventual exploration. And sometimes, when the moment is right and life's chaos subsides, I do pick one up and discover exactly why I needed it on my shelf.

## Connecting the Dots

There's an interesting parallel between Predictive History and my book collection. Both involve recognizing patterns across domains, seeing connections others might miss, and understanding that knowledge—whether historical or literary—is most powerful when it's interconnected.

Professor Jiang teaches us that history isn't isolated events but patterns waiting to be decoded. Similarly, these books aren't random acquisitions—they form a constellation of ideas about power, wisdom, human nature, markets, science, and meaning. When (if?) I read them all, they'll inform each other in unexpected ways.

## Moving Forward

My goal isn't just to consume these books but to engage with them deeply, to let them challenge my assumptions and expand my thinking. And who knows? Perhaps understanding predictive history will help me predict when I'll actually finish reading them all.

Until then, I'll keep learning from Professor Jiang's analyses, adding to my collection, and occasionally making progress through these intellectual mountains.

If you're interested in:

- How history can predict the future
- Interdisciplinary approaches to understanding geopolitics
- Building your own intellectual journey

I highly recommend exploring Predictive History. And if you have book recommendations that connect to these themes—or strategies for actually reading the books you own—I'd love to hear from you.
