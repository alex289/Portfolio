After getting my own Linux server, I wanted to have a server that I could use for my home.
I wanted to use a Raspberry Pi, because it is cheap, easy to setup and has a lot of software that I can use.
I also wanted to use Docker, because I like to have my software in containers.
In this blog post I will explain how I set my Raspberry Pi up and how I use it.

## Specifications

- Raspberry Pi 5 with 8 GB RAM
- SanDisk Ultra microSDHC 128GB 140MB/s A1
- Raspberry Pi 27W USB-C-power adapter black EU
- Argon ONE V3 M.2 NVME PCIE case SDSQUA4-128G-GN6MN

Total: ** ~150€**

## Setup

### Preparation

1. Get the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Select the latest Raspberry Pi OS image (full)
3. Configure the image

- Hostname: `raspberrypi`
- Username/Password: ...
- Wifi SSID/Password: ...
- Timezone: Europe/Berlin
- Keyboard layout: de
- SSH: Enabled (Optional: Add your public key)

4. Flash the image to the SD card

### Installation

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  The Argon ONE case had one issue where the start button didnt work. The power
  jumpers (the 1/2 vs the 2/3 connection, which controls the power behavior) had
  a problem where only the 2/3 connection worked.
</Callout>

1. Assemble the SD card and case with the Raspberry Pi

2. Boot up

3. Test with ssh and with a display

4. Update the system

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

# If required, reboot
sudo reboot
```

### Configuration

For the initial configuration, I setup a few basic stuff: git, neovim, docker and NodeJS.

```bash
sudo apt install git curl wget gcc neovim

git config --global credential.helper store
git clone https://github.com/alex289/astronvim_config.git ~/.config/nvim

# Install NodeJS
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
nvm install node
```

```bash
# Add Dockers official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
# VERSION_CODENAME should be sth like bookworm
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "bookworm") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

#### Static IP

One important thing to do is to set a static IP for the Raspberry Pi.
This is important because I want to use the AdGuard Home DNS server to resolve my domains and block ads.

One problem I encountered was that my router didnt have a DHCP server to set IPs.
Luckily, there are multiple solutions:

- Use AdGuardHome as a DHCP server
- Set a static IP on the pi itself

## Software

### AdGuard Home

One of the most popular projects to use on a Raspberry Pi is [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome), which is a DNS server that can be used to block ads and resolve domains.
I was also considering using Pi-hole, but the UI and the configuratino of AdGuard convinced me.

I didnt use Docker here on purpose, because I wanted AdGuard to be more near to the os and hardware to improve performance.
I dont think this makes much of a difference, but since there is no disadvantage, I will use the basic installation here.

```bash
cd

# Get the arm version of the pi
cat /proc/cpuinfo

# Replace armv6 with the ARM version that is best supported by your Pi
wget 'https://static.adguard.com/adguardhome/release/AdGuardHome_linux_armv6.tar.gz'
tar -f AdGuardHome_linux_armv6.tar.gz -x -v

cd ./AdGuardHome/
sudo ./AdGuardHome -s install

# AdGuardHome -s status
```

### Glances

[Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) is a monitoring tool which provides a UI that shows all hardware and software information of the system.
I just wanted something lightweight and simple to just show me the current status of my system.
It really has all information I could need and has a responsible UI.

### Home Assistant

One of my childhood dreams was to have a home automation system.
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a great project that can be used to control all kinds of devices.
As I already had a smart TV I could try to get used to it before getting all kinds of IoT devices.
One cool thing about this is that it has an integration for AdGuard Home where I can control different things.

I know it is recommended to use the Home Assistant Operating System but since I want to use other stuff I chose Docker.
Maybe in the future I will get another Raspberry Pi and split my homelab into two servers.

```yaml
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: homeassistant
    image: 'ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable'
    volumes:
      - ./home-assistant-data:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
```

#### Zigbee2mqtt

A lot of smart home devices only work with Zigbee which is a specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols.
In order to use Zigbee devices you need a Zigbee Router like the SLZB-06. In combination with a [Zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) adapter you can use the Zigbee devices with Home Assistant.

```yaml
services:
  mqtt:
    container_name: mqtt
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:2.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - './mosquitto-data:/mosquitto'
    ports:
      - '1883:1883'
      - '9001:9001'
    command: 'mosquitto -c /mosquitto-no-auth.conf'

  zigbee2mqtt:
    container_name: zigbee2mqtt
    image: koenkk/zigbee2mqtt
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./zigbee2mqtt-data:/app/data
      - /run/udev:/run/udev:ro
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
```

```yaml
permit_join: true
mqtt:
  base_topic: zigbee2mqtt
  server: mqtt://mqtt
serial:
  # Replace the ip address with your SLZB-06 ip
  port: tcp://192.168.1.12:6638
frontend:
  port: 8080
advanced:
  network_key: GENERATE
```

### Tailscale

In my last post I already wrote about how I use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) to connect to my Server.
Just for completeness, I installed it on my Raspberry Pi too.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

sudo tailscale up
```

One advantage of this is that my ubuntu server can now access my Raspberry Pi via Tailscale.
This means I can configure my reverse proxy to function as a tunnel for home assistant so I can access it outside of my local network.

### MagicMirror

The coolest thing to have in your home in my opinion is a MagicMirror.
When friends visit you and they see a mirror with some calendar, clock and weather, they will be very impressed.
Also its great to have the most import information in one place where you would at anyway.

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror
cd MagicMirror/
npm run install-mm

# If no existing config
cp config/config.js.sample config/config.js

# Setup ICloud calendar sync
# https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/5327/sync-private-icloud-calendar-with-magicmirror?page=1&lang=de

# If on the Raspberry Pi
npm start
# Via SSH
DISPLAY=:0 nohup npm start &
```

#### Modules

This is a list of all the modules I use.

- Alert: Shows some alerts when something happens
- Update notification: Shows a notification when a new update is available
- Clock: Shows the current time lol
- Calendar: Shows my iCloud calendar events
- Compliments: Who doesnt like compliments?
- Weather: Shows the current weather and the forecast
- News: Shows some RSS feeds of some news sources to show you the latest news
- [DailyPokemon](https://github.com/NolanKingdon/MMM-DailyPokemon): Shows a pokemon with its stats and switches everyday.
- [OnSpotify](https://github.com/Fabrizz/MMM-OnSpotify.git): Shows the current song played on Spotify with album cover, artist and song name. (With a touchscren you could even control it)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I had lot of fun setting up my Raspberry Pi and I am very happy with the result.
Im excited what I will do with it in the future with it.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. Thanks for reading!
